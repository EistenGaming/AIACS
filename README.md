# Project Overview

There is more to AI than LLMs.

The "AI Algorithms Cheat Sheet" aims to be a useful resource for your AI ambitions. Its goal is to provide a way for researchers and developers to find algorithms that fit their business or research problem best. The algorithms (around 300 at this time) are categorized into three main sections: Supervised Algorithms, Semi-Supervised Algorithms and Unsupervised Algorithms.

Each entry names the algorithm, offers a short description, use cases and a rationale for the mentioned use cases.

I greatly encourage anyopne to contribute! If you find a mistake, or a glaring omission - reach out to me at zen@eistengaming.com, raise an issue or, even better, correct it and create a pull request. All feedback is welcome.
